              <h4 class="mb-20">About This Tour</h4>
              <p class="mb-15">Rudyard Kipling wrote The Jungle Book, a collection of stories published in 1894 about the “man-cub” Mowgli who grew up alongside animals in the wilds of India. For many people, these stories defined our idea of India as an exotic place, full of adventures amidst the dense foliage with predator and prey lurking around every corner. The reality nowadays is somewhat different. India is the 7th largest country on the planet, it has the 2nd largest population. Sadly, over-population has diminished natural landscapes and endangered wildlife, but the government of India is doing all it can to protect its rich and diverse wildlife in more than 120 national parks, 18 bio-reserves and 500 wildlife sanctuaries.<br><br>
Toto Tours has organized many tours to India, but this is the first that will place primary focus on its wildlife. In addition to seeing rare animals in their natural environment, you will also experience the best of Indian heritage and culture. Around every corner another wonder of India’s kaleidoscopic richness reveals itself — Hindu temples, Buddhist stupas, Mughal forts, British colonial architecture and the glorious Taj Mahal. We invite you to experience an adventure like no other!

                  <p>Transfer to the airport for our mid-morning flight to Nagpur, arriving just after noontime. A driver will meet us at the airport. After lunch we proceed to our lodge at Kanha National Park. It is one of India’s largest parks, covering almost 2000 kilometers of pristine Indian wilderness. It boasts a spectacular landscape of vast sal tree forests, interspersed with flourishing green meadows and beautiful stretches of lush bamboo growth. This national park is one of the first nine tiger reserves established with the initial launch of Project Tiger in 1973, aimed at protecting tigers and their ecosystems. Kanha is prime tiger wilderness, and it remains Project Tiger’s greatest success story. Today is a travel day with free time to enjoy our lodge. Our first visit to the park will be tomorrow. Overnight in Kanha.  <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

                  <p>Today we enjoy morning and afternoon safaris by jeep. There are numerous tiger reserves in India, but nowhere can you see these magnificent creatures as often and as regularly as in Kanha National Park. There are also herds of spotted deer to be seen with smaller herds of beautiful Antelope and Black Buck. With a little luck, you could also spot the timorous Barking Deer and the rare Barasingha (the Swamp Deer). Once there were only 66 of these in Kanha, but careful conservation and management raised their population to over 400. Spotting wild animals is always a matter of luck but Kanha is so rich in wildlife that the odds are tilted in your favor. There are 175 varieties of birds in Kanha, and visitors often catch glimpses of all the grazers, porcupine, Gray Langurs, mongoose, hyena, even a Leopard. <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

This was an ancient stronghold of many kings in a land with history dating back roughly 4000 years. This park, which was once the private game reserve of the ruling family of Rewa, holds the distinction of being the home of the last White Tiger in the wild. The park is dotted with many caves that have ancient rock paintings and carvings. Majestic Bandhavgarh Fort dominates the center of the park with its own history dating back thousands of years. Various temples with statues depicting incarnations of Lord Vishnu are inside the fort. We check in and enjoy dinner and overnight at our Bhandhavgarh lodge. <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

                  <p>After breakfast drive to Khajuraho, a small town located in the heart of India and famous for its erotic temples. The Chandela rulers built these temples in a short span of 100 years from 950-1050 AD. Out of 85 temples, only 20 have survived the ravages of time. The temples belong to two different religions – Hinduism and Jainism. They are in three groups in an area of about 8 square miles. The western group is the largest and most important, while the group just east of the present Khajuraho village contain Brahmin and Jain shrines. The Southern group houses the Chaturbhuj Temple and the Eastern Temple. Enjoy a sound and light show at the temple complex this evening.  <strong style="font-style: italic">(Breakfast / Dinner)</strong></p>

                  <p>Gwalior’s tradition as a royal capital continued until the formation of present day India, with the Scindias having their dynastic seat here. The new city of Gwalior became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from warrior kings, poets, musicians and saints, contributing to making it a capital renowned throughout the country. On a sightseeing tour this morning, we explore the 15th century Gwalior Fort, built on a sandstone precipice and overlooking the surrounding plains.<br>
                  Afterwards we depart Gwalior and drive to Agra, famous as the home to one of the Seven Wonders of the World – the Taj Mahal. The architectural splendor of the mausoleums, the fort and the palaces in Agra is a vivid reminder of the opulence of the legendary Mughal empire. We visit the Agra Fort and later the Itmad-ud-Daulah Tomb, an earlier version of the Taj Mahal. Time permitting, observe incredible marble-inlay craftsmen at work and see some of the other exquisite products produced here. Overnight in Agra. <strong style="font-style: italic">(Breakfast / Dinner)</strong></p>

It is one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, combining elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian styles. Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. We return to our hotel for breakfast, afterward checking out and driving to Fatephur Sikri, the deserted city. Built in 1571, it is one of the world’s most perfect ghost cities, with pristine red sandstone buildings as perfect as when they were first chiseled more than five centuries ago. We have plenty of time to explore the magnificent structures here before driving onward to Jaipur.

              <strong>NOTE:</strong> The recent trend in travel is for travelers to finalize their plans much closer to departure time than was customary in the past.

Please keep this in mind when making your travel plans.
              <h3>What to Bring</h3>
              In November, the weather will still be very warm in Mumbai (between 75 and 90), while temperatures in Khajuraho, Gwalior and other locations on this tour may range about 10 to 15 degrees cooler. Laundry can be done at some of the places where we stay for two or more nights. You will be happier if you pack half of the clothes you think you need, do laundry along the way, and save room in your suitcases for fantastic purchases!

              <h3>Money Matters</h3>
              The currency unit in India is the Rupee (INR). As of November 7, 2016, the interbank exchange rate was 66.6 INR to the U.S. $1.00. ATMs are readily available in the major cities, and offer the best exchange rate for obtaining local currency. Credit cards are also widely accepted in establishments catering to tourists.<br><br>
Tipping Guidelines—Virtually everyone in India expects to receive a tip. In tourist restaurants or hotels a 10% service charge is often added to bills. We will make collective tips to our drivers and guides, and a suggested tip amount will be provided prior to departure.

              <h3>The Toto Spirit</h3>
              Toto Tours provides Adventure Travel Experiences as differentiated from tours in the traditional sense. Adventure Travel allows (even encourages) you to be an active participant. Adventurers can be identified by certain traits. They are:
               <ul class="style-3">
                      <li>fun-loving optimists who have a sense of humor and accentuate the positive</li>
                      <li>good natured realists who are willing to accept situations as they exist</li>
                      <li>undaunted by the unexpected, like occasional delays or bad weather</li>
                      <li>willing to forego some of the amenities we normally take for granted</li>
                      <li>eager to try new things & test limits</li>
                      <li>punctual</li>
                      <li>not whiners!</li>
               </ul>
               Toto Tours is known for attracting great groups of people who are outgoing, interesting, and fun. You wouldn’t want to do this tour with anybody else!
