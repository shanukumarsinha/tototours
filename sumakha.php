              <h4 class="mb-20">About This Tour</h4>
              <p class="mb-15">“Sumakha” is a Sanskrit word that is both adjective (meaning “very joyous or gay”) and noun (meaning “a joyous festival”). It has been said that visiting India is like experiencing an ongoing festival. It can be an assault to the senses, with its multitudinous hoards of people, the vibrant colors of thousands of saris and turbans in a public market, and the spectacle of elaborate monuments from bygone eras. As large as Europe, India is where East meets West, and North meets South. It has one of the world’s oldest cultures, with a long history that is forever alive.
Around every corner another wonder of India’s kaleidoscopic richness reveals itself—Hindu temples, Buddhist stupas, Mauryan pillars, Mughal forts, British colonial architecture. Experience the world-famous marvels of Rajasthan during this comprehensive tour, including the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort, the Amber Fort, and many exotic shrines, temples and palaces. There are 9 UNESCO World Heritage Sites on this tour, which has been timed to take advantage of three different cultural festivals. Any visit to India is destined to be a life-changing experience.</p>

                  <p>Delhi is the capital, and third largest city of India. Delhi is actually twin cities comprised of Old Delhi and New Delhi. Old Delhi was the capital of India during Muslim rule from the 12th to the 19th century. New Delhi was established in 1911 by King George V who, feeling Calcutta was too remote, wanted a new capital for the Indian Empire. Delhi is a kaleidoscope that promises everything for a visitor–historic sites, heritage, tourism, museums, gardens, galleries, and more. Plan to arrive in Delhi for any time this afternoon or evening. Touring does not commence until tomorrow, but your hotel room will be available for your arrival any time after 3pm today. You will be personally greeted at the International Airport upon arrival, presented with a fresh flower garland, and transferred to our hotel.  <strong style="font-style: italic">(Meals Aloft)</strong></p>

We drive past India Gate, the massive memorial to commemorate Indian soldiers, and see the President’s House, official residence of the President of India, previously known as the Viceroy’s House. Finally we also visit Qutub Minar, the tallest brick minaret in the world and an important example of Indo-Islamic Architecture. This evening we will have a Welcome Dinner at our hotel.

                  <p>After breakfast we depart Delhi and drive to Agra, for centuries the center of art, culture, commerce and learning in India. Upon arrival, we check in to our hotel, with time to freshen up before sightseeing. Our first stop is Itmad-ud-Daula, one of the most beautiful of Mughal tombs. We visit a center for the exquisite art of setting semiprecious stones in marble, known as “parchin kari,” first introduced in India in the 17th century. At sunset we visit the world-famous Taj Mahal, a jewel of Muslim art and one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, harmoniously combining elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. Dinner at Pinch of Spice Restaurant.  <strong style="font-style: italic">(Breakfast / Dinner)</strong></p>

                  <p>After breakfast visit Agra Fort, situated around the bend of the Yamuna River from the Taj Mahal. Built principally as a military establishment in 1565, the massive red sandstone fort measures more than 1.5 miles long. Afterwards, we drive to Fatehpur Sikri, one of the world’s most perfect ghost cities. Built during the second half of the 16th century, Fatehpur Sikri (the City of Victory) was the capital of the Mughal Empire for only 10 years before a drought made it impossible to stay. After lunch, we transfer by road to Jaipur, where we check into the hotel upon arrival. This evening attend a “puja” (Sanskrit meaning reverence or homage) at Ganesh Temple, one of the oldest in Jaipur. The temple is located outside the main city walls, inside an exotic palace on a small hill still owned by the Maharaja’s family. <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

                  <p>After breakfast we make a triumphal entry into the Amber Fort on an elephant. The Amber Fort is a romantic Rajasthani Fort Palace, with a rustic exterior and a lavish interior. Miniatures painted on the walls depict hunting and war scenes as well as festivals. Precious stones and mirrors are embedded into the plaster. Inside the Fort visit the Jag Mandir or the Hall of Victory. Later we tour the city of Jaipur, visiting the Maharaja’s City Palace, which has been converted in part into a museum housing an impressive array of ancient weaponry, textiles, and costumes. Continue the city tour, visiting the Jantar Mantar, which is the largest stone and marble crafted observatory in the world, built from 1728 to 1734. We finish our tour with a walk through the busy lanes of the city past Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds). <strong style="font-style: italic">(Breakfast / Dinner)</strong></p>

We will have lunch in the small town of Phalodi and then continue toward drive Jaisalmer, a fairy-tale town in the Thar Desert founded about 800 years ago. This desert fortress is one of Rajasthan’s most exotic and unusual towns, the buildings exquisitely carved from golden-yellow sandstone in the 19th century. The old fort, built in the 12th century, stands on the high Trikuta hill, with beautifully carved Jain temples. Jaisalmer is also famous for its embroidery, Rajasthani mirror work, rugs, blankets, antique, and stonework.   <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

                  <p>The fort is the liveliest in India, with homes and shops tucked in hidden lanes swaddled in colorful Rajasthani cloths. About a quarter of the Old City’s population resides within the fort walls. Within the fort walls are a beautiful set of Jain temples built between the 12th and 15th centuries. Our guided walk about the city takes us to several havelis (mansions) built by wealthy merchants. They are still occupied by families, descendants of the original owners in most cases. After lunch we have free time to explore the winding narrow passages of the walled old city. In late afternoon we visit Khuri village, with houses of mud and straw decorated like the patterns on Persian carpets. Finally take a camel ride in the sand dunes just before sunset.  <strong style="font-style: italic">(All Meals)</strong></p>

After checking in to our hotel, we visit the 15th century Mehrangarh Fort perched majestically on a high hill. Enter through gates which bear the evocative handprints of the Sati queens, women of the royal harem who took their own lives when their men were defeated in battle. The fort has a series of spectacular palaces, each decorated with exquisite engravings, lattice and mirror work.

At sunset we take a boat ride on Lake Pichola. This evening we attend Holika Dahan Ceremony at City Palace. A bonfire is lit on the full moon night of Phaguna (one of the 12 months in the Hindu calendar) which, according to Hindu mythology, demonstrates the triumph of divine power over demonic strength.

              <strong>NOTE:</strong> The recent trend in travel is for travelers to finalize their plans much closer to departure time than was customary in the past. While we try to be as flexible as possible we often must turn away last minute registrants because we relinquish hotel space and air reservations 8 – 12 weeks prior to departure! Please keep this in mind when making your travel plans.
              <h3>What to Bring</h3>
              From mid-February to early March, the weather will still be very warm in Rajasthan India, with temperatures ranging between mid-50s to the mid-70s in Delhi, and slightly warmer in the desert regions. Laundry can be done at some of the places where we stay for two or more nights. You will be happier if you pack half of the clothes you think you need, do laundry along the way, and save room in your suitcases for fantastic purchases!
