                  <h5>Western Greenland | Where Amundsen Began</h5>
                  <p>In 1906, polar explorer Roald Amundsen became the first person to successfully cross the entire Northwest Passage. Start your voyage exactly where he did along the stunning West Coast of Greenland and north into Baffin Bay, which you explore for six days. Your enrichment and lecture program also begins, offering the first of many opportunities to delve deeper into the story of this dramatic and remote region.<br>
                  Based on ice, weather and sea conditions, your captain and expedition crew determine the day’s best sightseeing opportunities, which may include:<br><br>
                  <strong>Sisimiut:</strong> North of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut is both the northernmost city in Greenland able to maintain a year-round, ice-free port, as well as the southernmost town with sufficient snow for dogsledding in winter and spring. Visit the local museum with its exhibits on Inuit culture and Greenlandic colonial history, and meet a dog musher and his dogsled team.<br><br>
                  <strong>Disko Bay & Ilulissat:</strong> Cruise into Disko Bay, a wide inlet off of Baffin Bay first explored by Erik the Red in 985, when he established the first Norse settlements in Western Greenland. Discover the Ilulissat Icefjord, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, at the sea mouth of one of the fastest and most active glaciers in the world, Sermeq Kujalleq. The scene is spectacular with giant icebergs, floating growlers and bergy bits (large chunks of glacial ice), and the sounds of the calving ice-stream. Take a walking tour of Ilulissat, including a visit to the local history museum, and meet with villagers to learn about life in this often-harsh Arctic region. Enjoy a huskie dogsled demonstration and learn about the centuries-old methods of leather tanning still in practice today.<br><br>
                  <strong>Uummannaq Fjords:</strong> Located north of Ilulissat, the Uummannaq Fjord System is an awe-inspiring geological wonder teeming with marine life. Visit Karrat ø to enjoy the stunning view of the iceberg-studded bay and also discover the remains of ancient huts, made of whale bones and sod by traditional Thule hunters (ancestors of the Inuit) some 500 to 1,000 years ago.<br><br>
                  <strong>Upernavik:</strong> Founded in 1772, this summer camp for nomadic Greenland Inuit was an ideal hunting ground for whales, seals and fish. Witness this for yourself when you spend time with local villagers who still maintain a traditional way of life, living off the fish and seal populations common to the region. Visit the shops, church and local museum, the last of which offers an excellent display of Greenlandic life.   |  <strong style="font-style: italic"> Meals: B L D</strong>

                  <h5>Nunavut & the Canadian Arctic Archipelago | Heart of the Northwest Passage</h5>
                  <p>Cruise west across Baffin Bay and into the Canadian Arctic Archipelago of Nunavut, where you begin your journey to the heart and history of the Northwest Passage. The A&K Expedition Team continues to share captivating lectures to enhance your own discovery.<br>
                  As ‘Le Boreal’ winds its way through legendary channels and inlets, your crew and Expedition Team determines the best route based on ice, weather and sea conditions. Exciting excursions await and are likely to include:<br><br>
                  Pond Inlet: Located on the Northern end of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet, which translates to “Place of Mittima’s Grave,” is the noted gateway to the fabled Northwest Passage and a rich archaeological site.<br><br>
                  After clearing customs formalities for Nunavut, set off for a shore excursion to an area originally inhabited by the ancient Thule. Visit the Nattinnak Visitor’s Center or Toonoonik Sahoonik Co-op, where you can shop for artisan carvings made from local red and green soapstone, beautiful wall hangings and other handcrafted goods.<br><br>
                  <strong>Lancaster Sound:</strong> Situated between Devon Island and Baffin Island, this body of water forms the eastern entrance to the Parry Channel and the Northwest Passage. It’s also home to a rich abundance of Arctic cod, which in turn draws copious populations of sea birds and marine mammals. Beluga and endangered bowhead whales, the narwhal with its spiraling tusk, ringed and bearded seals, the enchanting polar bear, and mustached walrus, as well as northern fulmars, black guillemots and Arctic terns — all are among the fantastic wildlife that inhabit the area. Some may even come into view on thrilling Zodiac excursions and landings.<br><br>
                  <strong>Beechey Island:</strong> Historic moments in Arctic exploration define this island, best known for providing a safe haven to British explorer Sir John Franklin in 1845. Look east toward Resolute Bay at the huge silhouette of Cape Riley and imagine what Captain Franklin saw here in Erebus Harbour, were he took shelter for two years before his ill-fated attempt to conquer the Northwest Passage. See the wooden grave markers for three of Franklin’s men, now bleached by the sun, and visit the cenotaph memorial erected in memory of the lost explorer. It is an unforgettable experience.<br><br>
                  <strong>Fort Ross:</strong> An abandoned trading post on the tip of Somerset Island, Fort Ross was founded in 1937 as a place for trappers to barter Arctic fox pelts in exchange for food and necessities. Explore the remaining wooden buildings of the post, which closed in 1948, and imagine life in such a barren landscape. Keep an eye out for bowhead whales or, perhaps, take a Zodiac excursion to CoBay, where polar bears have been known to feed.<br><br>
                  <strong>Gjoa Haven:</strong> During his first attempt to transit the Northwest Passage on ‘Gjøa,’ Roald Amundsen used this natural harbor as a respite while waiting for ice conditions to improve. For two years, he lived with the Netsilik Inuits, learning their skills for survival and more efficient travel, which would later prove invaluable in his successful South Pole expedition. Today, Gjoa Haven has a population of 1,200 and still bears the historic significance of playing a key role in polar exploration.<br><br>
                  <strong>Victoria Island:</strong> Cruise along the south coast of Victoria Island, which straddles both Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, voyaging through Queen Maud Gulf, Dease Strait and Coronation Gulf. Expedition stops may include bird sanctuary Jenny Lind Island, where you may also spy its populations of musk ox, and Johansen Bay, home to the remains of a nomadic trapper basecamp. Your Expedition Team may also lead you to Ulukhaktok (Holman village) in Queen’s Bay for an unforgettable visit with its local Inuit people. Only in contact with the rest of the world since the middle of the 19th century, the people of Holman continue to practice a traditional lifestyle and represent surprising cultural diversity; experience both with a warm welcome at the shore, drum dances, fresh char and bannock rings (fried dough) prepared over an open fire, and tours of the town art center. Ulukhaktok is famous for its printmaking and you bear witness to the beautiful tradition here; also find carvings, hats made of coveted qiviut (musk ox wool) and ulus — traditional, half-moon-shaped knives used by women to prepare food and skins.   |  <strong style="font-style: italic"> Meals: B L D</strong></p>

                  <p>In the Northwest Territories at Franklin Bay, see the spectacular and enormous “Smoking Hills,” cliffs of bituminous shale that endlessly combust and burn. This rare geological phenomenon has likely been occurring for millennia, with layers of the relatively unstable mineral jarosite covering these hills. When the mineral comes into contact with cold air, it becomes red-hot and produces a thick, black smoke a fantastic sight not unlike the smoky fumaroles produced by volcanoes, though far rarer to see.   |   Meals: B L D</p>

                  <h5>Hershel Island & the Yukon Territory | Safe Haven in the Farthest Reaches</h5>
                  <p>During a long mapping expedition in 1826, Captain Franklin was the first European to lay eyes on this unique island at the northernmost point of the Yukon Territory. Named by Franklin, Herschel Island is a landmark in the West Arctic and has since served alternately as a whaling station, relay station and refuge for travellers. The island teems with wildlife that includes the migrating bowhead whale, walrus, moose, musk ox, Arctic fox and 94 species of birds. It is also one of the only places on earth where you may see a grizzly bear, black bear and polar bear, the last of which live along the ice edge in summer. Evidence of the island’s whaling culture and Thule Inuit predecessors remains near the shoreline, though it may not for much longer; the island is subject to extreme coastal erosion and scientists predict the shoreline will disappear under the waves within 50 years.   |   <strong style="font-style: italic">Meals: B L D</strong></p>

                  <h5>Beaufort & Chukchi Seas | Waters of the White One</h5>
                  <p>Typically dense with ice floes and fog, the Beaufort Sea opens up a 60-mile-wide coastal pass from August to September. From here, ‘Le Boreal’ cruises into the U.S. and clears at Point Barrow, Alaska. Sailing in the comfort of your luxury expedition cruiser, continue participating in eye-opening lectures led by the Expedition Team. Be on the lookout across the sea for bowhead and beluga whales, the latter of which sustain one of the largest populations in the world here. Still hunted on a sustenance quota basis by local Inuits, the sociable creatures often travel in numbers and are said to be quite “chatty,” with their trills, clicks and squeals audible above the surface. In the late evening, relax on your private balcony or join fellow guests out on deck to witness the northern lights, known for delivering a stunning display in autumn. Your voyage continues through this narrow passage between North America and the ever-changing Arctic ice cap.   |   <strong style="font-style: italic">Meals: B L D</strong></p>

              NOTE: The recent trend in travel is for travelers to finalize their plans much closer to departure time than was customary in the past. While we try to be as flexible as possible we often must turn away last minute registrants because we relinquish hotel space and air reservations 8 – 12 weeks prior to departure! Please keep this in mind when making your travel plans.
              <h3>What to Bring</h3>
              Montreal temperatures can reach the mid-80s in August and humidity is high.<br><br>
              During the month of September in Nome and Anchorage, daily highs range from 53°F to 42°F over the course of the month, while lows can fall in the 30s.<br><br>
              In the Arctic Polar regions, rough weather conditions are common in any season in this region and it is difficult to predict the weather as it is quite unstable. Summer lasts from mid-July to the end of August. The sun comes up for approximately 14 hours per day; however, it is not high in the sky and does not provide much warmth. Cloudy skies and fog are common on some of the areas visited on this itinerary especially on and around Little Diomede. Most of the regions visited on this itinerary have a polar climate, with no month having an average temperature higher than 50°F due to the surrounding cold waters. Average lows range in the 30s. Wind chills can make it feel quite a bit colder. Arctic cyclones can come very fast, lasting for several days or disappearing in couple hours. In general at this time of year, the snow has almost disappeared in coastal areas and it can be quite pleasant.<br><br>
              Use a website such as weather.com to find average temperatures and rainfall during your travel times.<br>

              <h5>Money Matters</h5>
              <p>In Greenland, the unit of currency is the Danish Krone.<br><br>
              Canada’s unit of currency is the Canadian Dollar.<br><br>
              The U.S. Dollar is the currency in the United States.<br><br>
              In Canada, U.S. cash is accepted at established exchange rates at many hotels, restaurants and shops. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are very common and many U.S. issued bankcards are compatible with them.<br><br>
              In Canada, U.S. cash is accepted at established exchange rates at many hotels, restaurants and shops. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are very common and many U.S. issued bankcards are compatible with them.<br><br>
              During your voyage, you are likely to visit a number of Inuit villages in Nunavut and Northwest Territories of Arctic Canada. On these excursions you have the opportunity to engage with members of the local communities which are known for creating craft items and artwork. Items will be available for purchase (cash only) and and it is recommended that you have Canadian dollars as international funds cannot be exchanged and credit cards are not accepted. Artwork and carvings will cost in the range of CAD$100-$400 (although some carvings may cost more). Other smaller handmade souvenir items are less expensive. You can exchange Canadian dollars prior to departure or upon your arrival in Montreal.<br><br>
              We suggest travelling with some U.S. dollars to be exchanged for local currency and at least two major credit cards. If you have a “Chip and PIN” card, be careful to shield your number from view while entering it on a keypad; never disclose your PIN verbally. Notify your credit card company of your travel plans prior to your departure to avoid any fraud concerns.<br><br>
              Foreign currency can be exchanged only at authorized agencies such as banks and bureaus de change. Exchange currency only at authorized outlets such as exchange kiosks, banks and hotels and exchange only what you think you will need during your trip. Save all receipts from any currency transaction. You may be asked to produce them when you exit the country, and they are required if you intend to reconvert local currency.<br><br>
              We do not recommend traveller’s checks as they are not as widely accepted as in previous years.<br><br>
              Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are very common and many U.S. issued bankcards are compatible with them.<br><br>
